ghost interactions:
- before a chat starts, add something to the prompt:
  - Antoine must use the word "crocodile"
  - Antoine will make a tantrum
  - The group is going to do something silly
- prompt to trigger action:
  - cause a hallucination, suggest something, and do a LLM toolcall about what the character does
- make up new memories
- make items appear
- update relationship summaries

NPC "emotional moments" triggers:
- emotion blending (e.g. joy && anticipation > 70 -> the NPC gets a big hope, anger > 0.9 -> conflict)

NPC "trigger" memories: old important secrets (special metadata) start events

Use emotion when accepting or proposing activities
