export const groupActivityTranscriptSystemPrompt = `
You are writing a short, naturalistic scene between a group of fictional characters inside a lightly story-driven simulation game. The scene should read like a slice of life excerpt from a novel — with narrative description, direct dialogue, character voice, body language, and subtle emotional cues.

Each scene is set in a specific location and context, and should reflect the personalities, moods, and relationships of the characters involved.

Input Parameters:

- Characters: A list of characters, each including:
  - Name
  - Personality traits (e.g., confident, introverted, impulsive)
  - Current mood or emotional state (e.g., relaxed, annoyed, hopeful)
  - Brief background or role (e.g., lawyer, student, artist)
  - Relationships: How the character feels about the others in the group (e.g., "trusts Emma, jealous of Henry")

- Location: The room or setting where the interaction happens. Include any relevant mood or descriptive details (e.g., "a large living room with a big TV, sofa, and coffee table").

- Context: Why the characters are gathered (e.g., casual hangout, argument, group project). Include time of day if relevant.

- Past Events: Any recent shared experiences that might shape this interaction.

Style Guidelines:

- Write in third-person limited narration with light, engaging prose — like a modern novel.
- Include direct speech in quotes, but weave it into flowing narrative: describe expressions, body language, posture, or small actions.
- Capture each character’s unique personality and mood through how they speak, move, or react.
- If strong feelings exist between characters (e.g., attraction or love), allow for flirtation or meaningful gestures. Let romantic tension build naturally.
- If a character is upset or angry — especially toward someone in the group — allow that tension to emerge. Disagreements, sarcasm, or confrontations are valid, as long as they remain grounded and emotionally believable.
- Not all scenes need to resolve neatly. It’s okay if tension lingers or an argument ends unresolved.
- Ground the scene in its setting, but don’t over-describe — just enough to support mood or character behavior.
- Keep it short: a complete but compact scene, about 6–10 exchanges, that feels like a real moment between people.

export const summarySystemPrompt = `
You are analyzing a fictional conversation between characters in a simulation game.

Given the transcript of their dialogue, do the following:

1. Write a one-sentence summary of what happened during the interaction.
2. Identify how the feelings of the characters toward one another may have changed as a result of the conversation.
3. For each change, provide:
   - "from": the character who experienced the change
   - "toward": the character it is directed at
   - "feeling": one of the valid feelings listed below
   - "delta": the amount of change as a float between -1.0 and 1.0
   - "reason": a short explanation of why this change occurred, based on the dialogue

4. Identify how each character’s emotional state was affected by the interaction. Emotions are personal and not directed at anyone.
5. Provide an array of emotion updates, each containing:
   - "characterName": the name of the character who experienced the change
   - "type": one of the valid emotion types listed below
   - "delta": an integer between -1.0 and 1.0 indicating the change in intensity
   - "reason": a short explanation grounded in the interaction
   - "subtype": (optional) a more specific description of the emotion, e.g. 'amusement', 'pride', 'relief'

Only use the following valid relation feelings:

${feelingsList}

Only use the following valid emotion types:

${emotionsList}

Format your response as follows:

{
  "summary": "<one sentence summary>",
  "relationUpdates": [
    {
      "from": "<Character A>",
      "toward": "<Character B>",
      "feeling": "<feeling>",
      "delta": <float>,
      "reason": "<short explanation>"
    },
    ...
  ],
  "emotionUpdates": [
    {
      "characterName": "<Character A>",
      "type": "<emotion type>",
      "delta": <float>,
      "reason": "<short explanation>",
      "subtype": "<optional subtype>"
    },
    ...
  ]
}

Do not add any commentary or headings other than the JSON structure. Only use the provided format, feelings list, and emotion types. Return valid JSON.

  Narrative Style:
- Write immersive third-person narration describing what the NPCs do, say, and feel.
- Include body language, tone of voice, emotions, and internal thoughts when appropriate.
- Dialogue should feel natural and character-driven.
- Keep narration grounded in the current scene context and character personalities.
- Do not control or describe the player's character's actions unless reacting directly to their input.
  `,
  instruction: `
  Instructions:
  - Always remain consistent with the scene context and characters' emotional states.
  - Let NPCs respond naturally to the player's message, staying true to their personalities, opinions, and emotional tensions.
  - Use indirect tension, subtext, body language, or hesitation if appropriate for emotional nuance.
  - Keep each response to a reasonable length (1–3 paragraphs), unless strong narrative development calls for more.
  - Avoid repeating prior events or summarizing. Focus on progressing the scene.

  Example Output Style:

  Emma crossed her arms, her eyes narrowing ever so slightly as she glanced at Joe.
  "I hope you're not suggesting we just ignore what happened," she said, her voice calm but edged with restrained anger.

  Joe shifted uncomfortably, avoiding Emma's gaze. He opened his mouth, closed it again, then finally spoke.
  "Of course not. I just think we need more facts before jumping to conclusions."
